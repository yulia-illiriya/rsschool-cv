## About me 

I am an open-minded, easy-going and smart person. I love my life, my work, the people around me and the new tasks. Every day I try to learn something - and I finally want to change my direction and start new one. 

As a plus, I have strong soft skills - I worked for years as a journalist and PR manager. Now I am learning IT, and hope to reach new heights.
